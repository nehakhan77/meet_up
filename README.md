**Project Features & Scenarios**

**Filter Events By City** 
As a user, I should be able to filter events by city, so that I can see a list of events taking place in that city.

Scenario: Given the user is on the events app home screen, when the user types in a specific city in the search box, then that specific city will be shown with the events taking place in it.

**Show/Hide Event Details**
As a user, I should be able to show and hide event details, so that I can select a specific event and see further information about it and be able to hide it once I'm finished for easy readability. 

Scenario: Given a user is viewing a list of events, when the user clicks on a specific event, then further details of the event should be displayed.
Scenario: Given a user is viewing further details on an event, when they click on the collapse button, then the details of that event should be hidden and the app will be returned to the main event screen.

**Specify Number of Events**
As a user, I should be able to specify the number of events per page, so that I can filter it to my preference and have the events displayed in a visually appealing manner.

Scenario: Given a user is viewing a list of events, when the user clicks on an available option from the “events per page” filter, then that specific amount of events will be displayed on the events screen.

**Use the App When Offline**
As a user, I should be able to use my app offline, so that I can still access information and perform tasks regardless of poor connection.

Scenario: Given a user has poor connection, when the user opens the app, then they will have access to cached event data and still be able to perform tasks on the app.

**Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen**
As a user, I should be able to add an app shortcut to the homescreen, that way I can quickly open my app in a recognizable place rather than excessively scrolling through all my apps to search for it each time.

Scenario: Given a user has the events app downloaded to their device, when the user adds a shortcut to the app from their home screen, then their device will be able to create a shortcut that has easy access to the app.

**Display Charts Visualizing Event Details**
As a user, I should be able to display charts visualizing event details, so that I can easily see and compare data for that event.

Scenario: Given a user is viewing a list of events, when the user clicks on the charts option for a specific event, then the app should display charts given event related data.


**Use of Serverless Functions in the Meet Up App**

Serverless functions will play a vital role in the meet up app to provide OAuth2 tokens, authorize users to gain access to the Google Calendar API, manage user access , enable fast communication, and provide real-time data processing. Serverless functions offer benefits such as easy scability, cost efficiency, and being time-saving as well.
